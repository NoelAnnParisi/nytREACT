# Rediscover the NY Times 
Using MERN I've designed an app that allows you to search for archived New York Times articles. You can search for articles dating back to the 1800s, or articles of today. If you find one you really like, save it! 

## Built using... 
* React.js
* Webpack
* React Router v4
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* Node.js
* Axios
* Reactstrap

### Next Steps...
1. Add authentication
2. Tweak UI
